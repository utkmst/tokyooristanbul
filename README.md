# Istanbul or Tokyo Classifier

This project is a machine learning model that classifies images as either **Istanbul** or **Tokyo** based on architectural and visual features. The model has been trained on a dataset of 400 images to enhance its accuracy.

## Important!
This website is built on the [Clarity Template](https://github.com/lorenmt/clarity-template)'s free version and customized for classification of Istanbul and Tokyo.

## Features
- Upload an image to determine whether it belongs to Istanbul or Tokyo.
- Uses deep learning techniques for image classification.
- Deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces** with an interactive interface.
- Designed for fast and accurate predictions.

## Live Demo
You can try the model directly on our hosted space:

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/utkmst/tokyooristanbul
   cd tokyooristanbul
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the model:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (for model development)
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** (for training the model)
- **Gradio** (for building the user interface)
- **Hugging Face Spaces** (for deployment)
- **HTML & CSS** (for the web interface)

## How It Works
1. Upload an image to the web interface.
2. The model analyzes the architectural and visual features.
3. It predicts whether the image is from **Istanbul** or **Tokyo**.
